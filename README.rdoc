== AJAX Chat

Open Source chat concept developed in Ruby on Rails and jQuery.
Feel free to fork it, clone it, whatever.

Please note that I have not finished this application.

== How to run it locally?
Of course you should clone it first.
Make sure that you have PostgreSQL installed.
Then:

<tt>bundle install</tt>

<tt>rake db:create db:migrate</tt>

<tt>rails s</tt>
